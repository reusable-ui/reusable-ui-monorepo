/**
 * Resolves the current focused/blurred state for a fully controlled component.
 * 
 * This hook is intended for components that **consume** the resolved `focused` state and **forward** it to a base component.
 * 
 * Unlike `useFocusBehaviorState()`, which handles animation and lifecycle,
 * `useFocusState()` performs a lightweight resolution of the effective focus value.
 * 
 * - No internal state or uncontrolled fallback.
 * - `'auto'` is treated as a declarative diagnostic mode.
 * - Ideal for components that **consume** the resolved `focused` state.
 * 
 * @template TElement - The type of the target DOM element.
 * 
 * @param props - The component props that may include a controlled `focused` value and derived `computedFocus` value.
 * @param options - An optional configuration for customizing focus/blur behavior.
 * @returns The resolved focused/blurred state and event handlers for focus/blur events.

/**
 * Resolves the focus state, current transition phase, associated CSS class name, and animation event handlers
 * based on component props, optional default configuration, and animation lifecycle.
 * 
 * - Supports controlled focus state, when `focused` is set to `true` or `false`.
 * - Supports diagnostic mode, when `focused` is set to `'auto'`, which derives the effective focus from `computedFocus`.
 * - Supports input-like styling behavior via `inputLikeFocus`, which forces a focus ring to appear when focused—mimicking native `<input>` semantics even on mouse click.
 * 
 * @template TElement - The type of the target DOM element.
 * 
 * @param props - The component props that may include a controlled `focused` value, derived `computedFocus` value, and `onFocusUpdate` callback.
 * @param options - An optional configuration for customizing focus/blur behavior and animation lifecycle.
 * @returns The resolved focused/blurred state, current transition phase, associated CSS class name, and animation event handlers.

    /*
        ⚠️ React Strict Mode Consideration:
        This hook uses two effects to ensure **consistent behavior** across strict and non-strict modes.
        The observer effect emits phase change events, while the setup effect tracks the mount status.
        The setup effect must be placed after observer effect in order to correctly emit events for subsequent updates only.
        
        This configuration ensures that phase change events are emitted only for SUBSEQUENT UPDATES.
        The first update never emits any events.
        
        Sequence on initial mount:
        1. First render
            → observer effect runs → but SKIPS event emission due to `hasMountedRef = false`
            → setup effect runs → marks `hasMountedRef = true`, allowing further updates to emit events
        2. [Strict Mode] Simulated unmount
            → observer cleanup (noop)
            → setup cleanup → resets `hasMountedRef = false`, preventing further updates from emitting events
        3. [Strict Mode] Second render
            → observer effect runs → SKIPS event emission again due to `hasMountedRef = false`
            → setup effect runs → marks `hasMountedRef = true`, allowing further updates to emit events
        So effectively, the initial mount does NOT emit any events in both strict and non-strict modes.
        
        Sequence on subsequent updates of `focusPhase`:
            → observer effect runs → emits phase change event
            → setup effect does NOT run (no changes in dependencies)
        
        Sequence on final unmount:
            → observer cleanup (noop)
            → setup cleanup → resets `hasMountedRef = false`
