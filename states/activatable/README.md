# @reusable-ui/activatable

⚠️ **Deprecated since v7.0.0**  
This package is no longer functional. It exists only as a **migration tool** to guide contributors toward [`@reusable-ui/active-state`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reusable-ui/active-state).

- Last working version: **6.5.1**
- Current version: **7.0.0** (migration shim only)

---

## ✨ What changed?

`@reusable-ui/activatable` has been replaced by **`@reusable-ui/active-state`**, which provides a clearer, more consistent lifecycle model for active/inactive behavior in UI components.

The old API surface is marked with `@deprecated` JSDoc tags and points to the new equivalents. This release does **not** provide a working implementation — it only helps you migrate.

```

If you are still on legacy code and need migration hints:

```bash
npm install @reusable-ui/activatable@7
```

- If you are pinned to v6.5.1, you can continue using it, but it will not receive updates.
