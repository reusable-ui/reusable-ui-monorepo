# @reusable-ui/view-state 📦  

**view-state** is a reusable abstraction for managing view-switching in UI components.  
It provides a lifecycle-aware way to animate transitions between views, exposing semantic variables that make styling and contributor reasoning clear.  

Instead of manually handling DOM swaps or relying only on snapshot-based APIs, view-state preserves old, intermediate, and new views during transitions. This makes it ideal for components that need smooth, teachable animations — such as carousels, slides, tabs, or stepped flows — while still giving implementors the flexibility to choose how views are rendered.  

With **view-state**, you get:  
- Controlled view-switching feedback  
- Transition animations tied to real DOM nodes  
- Semantic styling variables (`viewIndex`, `prevViewIndex`, `isViewTransitioning`, etc.) for fine-grained control  

## 🔀 Choosing Between View-state and View Transition API

Both **view-state** and the **View Transition API** help animate changes between views, but they serve different purposes. This section explains their overlap, strengths, and when to choose one over the other.

### 🧩 View Transition API
- **What it is**: A browser-native API that snapshots the old and new DOM states and animates between them using pseudo-elements (`::view-transition-old` / `::view-transition-new`).  
- **Use cases**:
  - Page navigations (MPAs)  
  - Simple SPA state changes (toggle, replace content)  
  - Adding polish to apps not originally designed for animation  
- **Pros**:
  - Minimal setup (`document.startViewTransition()`)  
  - Works across page navigations  
  - No need to refactor existing DOM logic  
- **Cons**:
  - Only animates snapshots (like static images)  
  - Limited CSS properties (opacity, transform, filter, etc.)  
  - No intermediate states — just old → new  

### 🧩 View-state
- **What it is**: A reusable abstraction that preserves old, intermediate, and new views during animation, exposing transition variables (`viewIndex`, `prevViewIndex`, `isViewTransitioning`, etc) to provide fine-grained control over styling.  
- **Use cases**:
  - Carousels and slideshows  
  - Stepped flows and wizards  
  - Complex UI transitions with intermediate states  
- **Pros**:
  - Animates real DOM nodes, not frozen snapshots  
  - Supports intermediate states and multi-step journeys  
  - Teachable math and lifecycle clarity for contributors  
- **Cons**:
  - Requires explicit setup and state modeling  
  - More code than a one-liner `startViewTransition()`  

### 🎯 Guidance
- Use **View Transition API** for **atomic swaps** (page navigation, click-to-toggle, simple DOM changes).  
- Use **view-state** for **structured flows** (carousel, wizard, stepped transitions) where intermediate states and contributor reasoning matter.  
- In hybrid apps, combine both: View Transition for simple navigations, view-state for complex journeys.

## 🧮 Selective Rendering (Optional)

**Selective rendering** means that only the views currently visible or actively transitioning are mounted in the DOM, rather than rendering every possible view at once. This approach helps keep the DOM lightweight during animations and can improve performance.  

The **view-state** library provides helper variables (`minVisibleViewIndex`, `maxVisibleViewIndex`) to indicate which views are relevant at a given phase. Using these values is optional — implementors may adopt selective rendering for efficiency, or simply render all views for simplicity.

### ✅ Example (Selective Rendering)
```tsx
const { minVisibleViewIndex, maxVisibleViewIndex } = useViewBehaviorState(props, ...);

const minRenderViewIndex = Math.floor(minVisibleViewIndex);
const maxRenderViewIndex = Math.ceil(maxVisibleViewIndex);

return (
  <div>
    {['First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Fourth', 'Fifth'].map((label, currentIndex) => (
      (currentIndex >= minRenderViewIndex && currentIndex <= maxRenderViewIndex) && (
        <div key={currentIndex} className={styles.item}>
          <p>{label} view</p>
        </div>
      )
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

### 🎯 Guidance
- **Selective rendering**:  
  - Render only views between `minVisibleViewIndex` and `maxVisibleViewIndex`.  
  - Benefits: smaller DOM, better performance, ideal for carousels or slideshows.  
- **Full rendering**:  
  - Render all views regardless of visibility.  
  - Benefits: simpler implementation, persistent DOM state.  

👉 Both approaches are valid. **view-state simply provides the tools** (`minVisibleViewIndex`, `maxVisibleViewIndex`) so you can choose the strategy that best fits your component.  

## ✨ Features
✔ Lifecycle-aware view-switching animations based on current view index  
✔ Gracefully completes running animations before resolving new state  
✔ Strongly typed CSS variables for safe, expressive styling across SSR and hydration  
✔ Seamless integration across appearance, animation, and feedback systems  
✔ Supports controlled, uncontrolled, and hybrid view-switching behavior  
✔ Indexing CSS variables (`--vi-viewIndex` and `--vi-prevViewIndex`) to animate transitions between views  
✔ Efficient JSX rendering — only renders views within the visible or transitioning range  
✔ Supports fractional view indices for scroll-sync and smooth preview transitions  
✔ Configurable snapping behavior via `viewIndexStep` (defaults to `1`) for integer-based or fractional transitions

## 🧩 Exported Hooks

### `useViewBehaviorState(props, options?)`

Resolves the current view index, current transition phase, associated CSS class name, and animation event handlers based on component props, optional default configuration, and animation lifecycle.

- Supports controlled, uncontrolled, and hybrid view-switching behavior with optional change dispatching.

#### 💡 Usage Example

```tsx
import React, { FC, MouseEventHandler } from 'react';
import {
    useViewBehaviorState,
    ViewStateProps,
    UncontrollableViewStateProps,
    ViewStateChangeProps,
} from '@reusable-ui/view-state';
import styles from './SlideBox.module.css';

export interface SlideBoxProps extends
    ViewStateProps,
    UncontrollableViewStateProps, // optional uncontrolled behavior
    ViewStateChangeProps<MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement>> // optional change dispatching behavior
{}

// A box that can switch views.
export const SlideBox: FC<SlideBoxProps> = (props) => {
    const {
        viewIndex,
        prevViewIndex,
        minVisibleViewIndex,
        maxVisibleViewIndex,
        actualViewIndex,
        viewPhase,
        viewClassname,
        viewStyle,
        
        dispatchViewIndexChange,
        
        handleAnimationStart,
        handleAnimationEnd,
        handleAnimationCancel,
    } = useViewBehaviorState(props, {
        defaultViewIndex  : 0,                                   // Fallback for uncontrolled mode.
        minViewIndex      : 0,                                   // Limits minimum view index to 0.
        maxViewIndex      : 4,                                   // Limits maximum view index to 4.
        viewIndexStep     : 1,                                   // Snaps to integer view indices.
        animationPattern  : ['view-advancing', 'view-receding'], // Matches animation names ending with 'view-advancing' or 'view-receding'.
        animationBubbling : false,                               // Ignores bubbling animation events from children.
    });
    
    // Determine which views to render based on visibility range:
    const minRenderViewIndex = Math.floor(minVisibleViewIndex);
    const maxRenderViewIndex = Math.ceil(maxVisibleViewIndex);
    
    return (
        <div
            className={`${styles.box} ${viewClassname}`}
            style={viewStyle}
            
            onAnimationStart={handleAnimationStart}
            onAnimationEnd={handleAnimationEnd}
        >
            {['First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Fourth', 'Fifth'].map((label, currentIndex) => (
                // Only render views within the visible or transitioning range to optimize performance:
                ((currentIndex >= minRenderViewIndex) && (currentIndex <= maxRenderViewIndex)) && <div
                    key={currentIndex}
                    className={styles.item}
                >
                    <p>{label} view</p>
                </div>
            ))}
            
            <button onClick={(event) => dispatchViewIndexChange(((viewIndex - 1) + 5) % 5, event)}>
                Prev
            </button>
            <button onClick={(event) => dispatchViewIndexChange((viewIndex + 1) % 5, event)}>
                Next
            </button>
        </div>
    );
};
```

#### 🧠 Transition Animation Behavior

The hook manages transitions when `viewIndex` changes using a unified animation flow:

- If a transition is already in progress, new intent (e.g., switching to another `viewIndex`) is deferred until the current animation completes.
- Once the active animation finishes, the latest intent is resumed and the corresponding transition begins.
- This ensures animations are never interrupted mid-flight and outdated transitions are discarded.

#### 🔒 Restricted Behavior (`disabled` or `readonly`)
- **Block dispatch; preserve last state**: When restricted, view-switch requests are ignored. The component remains at its last view index.  
- **On unrestricted (re-enabled or exit readonly)**: `dispatchViewIndexChange()` works normally.  
- **Rationale**: Restricted components freeze interaction — they don’t reset view index, but prevent user interactions until unrestricted.

### `useViewStatePhaseEvents(props, viewPhase)`

Emits lifecycle events in response to view phase transitions.

This hook observes the resolved `viewPhase` from `useViewBehaviorState()` and triggers the appropriate callbacks defined in `ViewStatePhaseEventProps`, such as:

- `onViewAdvancingStart`
- `onViewAdvancingEnd`
- `onViewRecedingStart`
- `onViewRecedingEnd`

### `useViewState(props, options?)`

Resolves the current view index for a fully controlled component.

This hook is intended for components that **consume** the resolved `viewIndex` value and **forward** it to a base component.

Unlike `useViewBehaviorState()`, which supports both controlled and uncontrolled modes, `useViewState()` assumes the component is **fully controlled** and does not manage internal state.

- Supports only controlled mode.
- Ideal for components that **consume** the resolved `viewIndex` value.

### `useViewIndexChangeDispatcher(props, options)`

Creates a stable dispatcher for requesting a change to the view index.

This hook is designed for **fully controlled components**—typically the outer `<DerivedComponent>` that manages the `viewIndex` value and forwards it to a `<BaseComponent viewIndex={...}>`.

Unlike `useViewBehaviorState()`, which supports both controlled and uncontrolled modes, `useViewIndexChangeDispatcher()` assumes the component is **fully controlled** and does not manage internal state.

- Supports only controlled mode.
- Always triggers `onViewIndexChange`, if provided.
- Ideal for components that **dictate** the `viewIndex` value externally and need a stable dispatcher without lifecycle orchestration.

### `useUncontrollableViewState(props, options?)`

Resolves the current view index and provides a dispatcher for requesting changes.

This hook is intended for components that **manage** the resolved `viewIndex` value and **forward** it to a base component, while optionally supporting uncontrolled behavior.

Unlike `useViewBehaviorState()`, which resolves full lifecycle, `useUncontrollableViewState()` provides a **simplified implementation** for managing view index state and dispatching changes.

- Supports both controlled and uncontrolled modes.
- If `viewIndex` is provided, the internal state is disabled and the component becomes fully controlled.
- If `viewIndex` is omitted, the internal state is initialized via `defaultViewIndex`.
- Ideal for components that **manage** the resolved `viewIndex` value.

## 🎨 CSS Selectors & Conditional Rule Helpers

```ts
import {
    // View-switching selectors:
    isViewSettledSelector,       // Targets `.view-settled` classes
    isViewAdvancingSelector,     // Targets `.view-advancing` classes
    isViewRecedingSelector,      // Targets `.view-receding` classes
    isViewTransitioningSelector, // Targets `.view-advancing` and `.view-receding` classes
    
    // Conditional styling helpers:
    ifViewSettled,       // Applies styles to elements in a fully settled state (not transitioning between views)
    ifViewAdvancing,     // Applies styles to elements currently advancing toward the next view (higher index)
    ifViewReceding,      // Applies styles to elements currently receding toward the previous view (lower index)
    ifViewTransitioning, // Applies styles to elements currently transitioning, either advancing or receding between views
} from '@reusable-ui/view-state';
import { style, rule } from '@cssfn/core';

export const componentStyle = () => style({
    fontSize: '1rem',
    ...ifViewSettled({
        opacity: 1,
    }),
    ...ifViewTransitioning({
        opacity: 0.5,
    }),
    
    // Alternative approach using explicit selectors:
    ...rule(isViewSettledSelector, { // equivalent to `ifViewSettled`
        scale: '100%',
    }),
    ...rule(isViewTransitioningSelector, { // equivalent to `ifViewTransitioning`
        scale: '80%',
    }),
});
```

## 🧩 Exported CSS Hooks

### `usesViewState(options?: CssViewStateOptions): CssViewState`

Generates CSS rules that conditionally apply the view-switching animations based on current view index, and exposes view-related CSS variables for conditional animation.

#### Supporting Variables (Advanced Use)

These variables are only active during their respective transition phases.  
Use `switchOf(...)` to ensure graceful fallback when inactive.

| Variable                 | Active When...                        | Purpose                                                                        |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `animationViewAdvancing` | `.view-advancing`                     | Runs the advancing animation sequence (0 → +1)                                 |
| `animationViewReceding`  | `.view-receding`                      | Runs the receding animation sequence (0 → -1)                                  |
| `isViewSettled`          | `.view-settled`                       | Conditional variable for the settled state                                     |
| `isViewAdvancing`        | `.view-advancing`                     | Conditional variable for the advancing transition                              |
| `isViewReceding`         | `.view-receding`                      | Conditional variable for the receding transition                               |
| `isViewTransitioning`    | `.view-advancing` or `.view-receding` | Conditional variable for the advancing/receding transition                     |
| `viewIndex`              | Always available                      | Current destination view index                                                 |
| `prevViewIndex`          | Having changed `viewIndex`            | Previous view index, used for directional inference                            |
| `viewFactor`             | Always available (animatable)         | Normalized factor: -1 ⇄ 0 ⇄ +1; resets to 0 after transition completes        |
| `viewFactorCond`         | Not fully settled                     | Conditional mirror of `viewFactor`, drops to `unset` when view is settled      |

#### 💡 Usage Example

```ts
// Animation feature:
import { usesAnimationFeature } from '@reusable-ui/animation-feature';

// View-switching state:
import { usesViewState } from '@reusable-ui/view-state';

// CSS-in-JS:
import { style, vars, keyframes, switchOf } from '@cssfn/core';

export const slideBoxStyle = () => {
    // Feature: animation handling
    const {
        animationFeatureRule,
        animationFeatureVars: { animation },
    } = usesAnimationFeature();
    
    // Feature: view-switching lifecycle
    const {
        viewStateRule,
        viewStateVars: { viewIndex, prevViewIndex, viewFactor },
    } = usesViewState({
        animationViewAdvancing : 'var(--box-view-advancing)',
        animationViewReceding  : 'var(--box-view-receding)',
    });
    
    return style({
        display: 'flex',
        // Define component styling here.
        
        // Apply animation feature rules:
        ...animationFeatureRule(),
        
        // Apply view-switching state rules:
        ...viewStateRule(),
        
        // The parent container is 100px wide and overflows hidden.
        // To show the correct view, we translate this box based on the current viewIndex.
        // We `translate` using `marginInlineStart` for better RTL support, because `translate` is physical, not logical.
        
        // Advancing animation: interpolate viewFactor from 0 → +1
        ...vars({
            '--box-view-advancing': [
                ['0.3s', 'ease-out', 'both', 'transition-view-advancing'],
            ],
        }),
        ...keyframes('transition-view-advancing', {
            from : { [viewFactor]:  0 },
            to   : { [viewFactor]:  1 },
        }),
        
        // Receding animation: interpolate viewFactor from 0 → -1
        ...vars({
            '--box-view-receding': [
                ['0.3s', 'ease-out', 'both', 'transition-view-receding'],
            ],
        }),
        ...keyframes('transition-view-receding', {
            from : { [viewFactor]:  0 },
            to   : { [viewFactor]: -1 },
        }),
        
        // Shift factor:
        // - Represents the signed destination index for visual translation.
        // - Advancing : shiftFactor =  viewFactor
        // - Receding  : shiftFactor = -viewFactor - 1
        // 
        // Direction detection is done inline using:
        //   clamp(0, (prevViewIndex - viewIndex) * 999999, 1)
        //   → If prev > view → receding → clamp = 1
        //   → If prev ≤ view → advancing → clamp = 0
        // 
        // The multiplier (999999) ensures fractional diffs (e.g. 0.00001) still trigger receding.
        '--_shiftFactor':
`calc(
    ${viewFactor}
    +
    clamp(0, calc((${switchOf(prevViewIndex, viewIndex)} - ${viewIndex}) * 999999), 1)
    * ((${viewFactor} * -2) - 1)
)`,
        
        // Example usage:
        // - Translate based on the distance between origin and destination views, interpolated by `--_shiftFactor`.
        // - 0 → origin view, ±1 → destination view.
        marginInlineStart: `calc(var(--_shiftFactor) * (${viewIndex} - ${prevViewIndex}) * -100px)`,
        contain: 'layout', // Contain layout to prevent reflows.
        willChange: 'margin-inline-start', // Hint to browser for better performance.
        
        // Apply composed animations:
        animation,
    });
};
```

#### 🧠 Resolution Logic

The `animationViewAdvancing` and `animationViewReceding` variables are only defined during their respective transition phases.

These variables are registered to `@reusable-ui/animation-feature`, so you typically don’t need to consume them directly.  
Instead, use `animationFeatureVars.animation` from `usesAnimationFeature()` to apply the unified animation stack—combining view-switching animations with other state-driven transitions.
