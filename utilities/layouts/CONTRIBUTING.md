# ⚠ DEPRECATED: Contributing to @reusable-ui/layouts ✍️  

🚨 **This package is deprecated** in favor of standard CSS `lh` units.  
Contributions should be directed to other actively maintained **Reusable-UI** modules.  

## 🔄 Migration Path  
If you previously contributed to `@reusable-ui/layouts`, here’s how to transition:  
- **Use `blockSize: '1lh'` and `inlineSize: '1lh'`** instead of the old functions.  
- **No longer maintained** – Future updates will be handled at the framework level.  
- **Remove unnecessary dependencies** – Projects using `@reusable-ui/layouts` should migrate fully.  

## 🚫 No Further Contributions

✔ Bug fixes
