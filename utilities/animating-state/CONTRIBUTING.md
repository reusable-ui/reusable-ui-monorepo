# Contributing to @reusable-ui/animating-state üé•

Thanks for stopping by! üöÄ  
This package has been **deprecated** in favor of [`@reusable-ui/animation-state`](https://github.com/reusable-ui/reusable-ui-monorepo/tree/main/utilities/animation-state),  
but we still welcome contributions that improve legacy compatibility, migration clarity, or documentation.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation Notice

This package wraps the newer `useAnimationState` logic from React 19,  
preserving the original API for compatibility with React 18-based projects.  
New animation features and improvements should target `@reusable-ui/animation-state`.
