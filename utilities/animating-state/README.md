# Contributing to @reusable-ui/animating-state 🎥

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 🚀  
This package has been **deprecated** in favor of [`@reusable-ui/animation-state`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reusable-ui/animation-state),  
but we still appreciate issues, migration suggestions, and maintenance PRs that support legacy compatibility.

## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice  
This package wraps the newer `useAnimationState` to provide backward compatibility.  
New features and improvements should target [`@reusable-ui/animation-state`](https://github.com/reusable-ui/reusable-ui-monorepo/tree/main/utilities/animation-state).
