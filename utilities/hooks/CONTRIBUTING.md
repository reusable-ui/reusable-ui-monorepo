# Contributing to @reusable-ui/hooks 📢

## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice
**`@reusable-ui/hooks` is deprecated** and now serves as a re-export package for:
- [`@reusable-ui/callbacks`](https://github.com/reusable-ui/callbacks)
- [`@reusable-ui/lifecycles`](https://github.com/reusable-ui/lifecycles)
- [`@reusable-ui/styles`](https://github.com/reusable-ui/styles)
- [`@reusable-ui/references`](https://github.com/reusable-ui/references)
- [`@reusable-ui/directionality`](https://github.com/reusable-ui/directionality)
- [`@reusable-ui/timers`](https://github.com/reusable-ui/timers)

Contributions should be directed **to these individual packages** rather than `@reusable-ui/hooks`.

## 🏗️ How to Contribute
Even though `@reusable-ui/hooks` is deprecated, you can contribute by:
1. **Improving migration guides** → Help users transition smoothly.
2. **Fixing re-export issues** → Ensure proper deprecation annotations and references.
3. **Enhancing documentation** → Provide clarity on usage of the re-exported packages.

## 🚀 Submitting a Pull Request
If submitting improvements related to **deprecations or re-exports**:
1. **Fork the repository**.
2. **Create a new branch** (`fix-deprecations` or `docs-improvement`).
3. **Ensure correct `@deprecated` annotations**.
4. **Update README and migration guides**.
5. **Submit your pull request** with a clear description.

## 📜 Code Style & Best Practices
Since `@reusable-ui-hooks` mainly re-exports items:
✅ Ensure **consistent formatting** in deprecation notices.  
✅ Use **clear and structured documentation**.  
✅ Avoid introducing **new implementations**—instead, contribute to specialized packages.

## ❓ Need Help?
